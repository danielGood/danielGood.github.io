A ray can be represented with a point and a vector.  The point is the origin of the ray, and the vector represents the angle and maximum distance.\r\n2. Set the initial maximum distance for the ray, and the initial maximum distance point.\r\n3.Iterate through all objects that need to be tested for intersection.\r\n4.    Check for intersection between the ray and the object\r\n    1.    If there is an intersection between the ray and the object, get the distance to the origin\r\n    2.   If the new distance to the origin is smaller than the recorded one record it and the point of intersection.\r\n5.    return intersection point     ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
