       <h3>About Me</h3>
	   <p>I am a programmer.  I view programming as a vehicle to bring my ideas to life.
     This is something I continually aspire to.  Computer Gaming is a big source of inspiration for me, and in line with this I have studied 
     A.I. and Computer Graphics.  Right now I am working with JavaScript and Angular 2, and in the past I have worked with Java.

Ray Casting Algorithm
This algorithm returns the first intersection in a ray.  It can be used for rendering and lighting.  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/A_basic_ray-caster">3d raycast world</a>.  Ray tracers, a variant of ray casting, are used to render high quality objects.  I will be using it in 2D to create lighting program.</p>

<ol>
<li>A ray can be represented with a point and a vector.  The point is the origin of the ray, and the vector represents the angle and maximum distance.</li>
<li>Set the initial maximum distance for the ray, and the initial maximum distance point.</li>
<li>Iterate through all objects that need to be tested for intersection.</li>
<li>   Check for intersection between the ray and the object

<ol>
<li>   If there is an intersection between the ray and the object, get the distance to the origin</li>
<li>  If the new distance to the origin is smaller than the recorded one record it and the point of intersection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>   return intersection point<br>
</li>
</ol>
