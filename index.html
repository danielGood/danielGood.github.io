	<h4>Task Manager</h4>
    <p>
An organizational app, Task Manager's goal is to automate organization and to reflect the user's will.  Right now, it is a task list with five variables task, status, deadline, starting date, and priority.  Existing tasks can be added, and more tasks can be added onto lists.  Their are five lists todo, daily, weekly, monthly, and overall.  
    </p>
     Planned \ Unimplemented Features
     <p>
The first automatic feature will use the starting date.  If there is is a starting date and it is before the current date then the task should not be visible on the task list.  There should be a seperate mode that allows you to see these tasks.  This means that you can put tasks on the tasklist ahead of time without crowding the list.  This has special significance for cyclical tasks like Christmas shopping or birthdays.  When the task for that year is finished the variables can be adjusted for next year.  A task alert system should be put in place to draw a user's attention to certain tasks.  It should not stress the user or disregard other tasks.  The program should allow the user to make and delete their own task lists.  The program should also allow the user to save certain task's that they do on a frequent basis.
